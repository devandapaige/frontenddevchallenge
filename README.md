## Steps to Create Project:

1. Used `npx create-react-app .` to make a blank React project in my created repository. I also installed dotenv for my API token from NASA.

2. Created a simple [wireframe](https://whimsical.com/nasa-spacestagram-3zU7YRjbffYjxEz7qKokuE) using Whimsical for what I want my React App to look like and then formatted the React App components to match my wireframe.

3. Before pulling data I created my Header, Footer, MainContent, LikesContainer, and DatePicker components to match the wireframe. I installed Bootstrap for this project to make the mobile version of the site work without too much extra work. I plan to pull the API request in the MainContent component to feed the data into the ImageContainer.

   -- Alternatively, I may use React-Redux to create a loading state and make the GET request that way. Still decided at this point while I build out the pre-state components.
